# JSGprogressbar: Dynamic Progress Bar Module for Python

JSGprogressbar is a lightweight Python module that provides an elegant solution for incorporating dynamic progress bars into your loops. Say goodbye to the days of tedious guesswork during lengthy operations ‚Äì with JSGprogressbar, you can effortlessly keep track of your loop's advancement in real-time, all while maintaining focus on your core logic.

## Features

- **Easy Integration**: Seamlessly integrate a progress bar into your loops with minimal code adjustments.
- **Real-time Updates**: Monitor the progress of your loop in real-time, eliminating uncertainty and improving user experience.
- **Customization Options**: Customize the appearance of the progress bar to match your application's aesthetics.
- **Completion Statistics**: Gain valuable insights into execution time and overall progress upon loop completion.
- **User-Friendly**: JSGprogressbar is designed with simplicity in mind, catering to programmers of all skill levels.
- **Versatile Compatibility**: Compatible with a wide range of Python projects, from data processing and analysis to simulations and batch operations.

## Usage

Simply import the `JSGprogressbar` class and create an instance, passing the required arguments:

```python
from sys import stdout

class bcolors:
    WARNING = '\033[93m'
    GRAY = '\033[0;90m'
    ENDC = '\033[0m'
    BOLD = '\033[1m'

def progressbar(it, prefix="", size=60, out=stdout): # Python3.3+
    count = len(it)
    def show(j):
        x = int(size*j/count)
        print("{}{}{} {}{}{}{}{} {} {}/{}".format(bcolors.BOLD,prefix,bcolors.ENDC,bcolors.WARNING, "‚îÅ"*x,bcolors.ENDC, bcolors.GRAY+"‚îÅ"*(size-x)+bcolors.ENDC,bcolors.WARNING,bcolors.ENDC, j, count), 
                end='\r', file=out, flush=True)
        
    show(0)
    for i, item in enumerate(it):
        yield item
        show(i+1)
    print("\n", flush=True, file=out)
```

Then, simply utilize the `progressbar` generator function within your loop to integrate the progress bar. Here's an example:

```python
from jsgprogressbar.progressbar import progressbar

def main():
    total_items = 1000
    items_processed = 0

    for item in progressbar(range(total_items), prefix='Processing', size=50):
        # Your processing logic here
        items_processed += 1

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

## Installation

JSGprogressbar can be easily installed using pip:

```bash
pip install jsgprogressbar
```
